        <p>There are many people in our society who cannot afford the high cost of medications, particularly those who
            are uninsured or underinsured. This often results in individuals not taking their prescribed medications,
            which can lead to serious health consequences. Additionally, there is a significant amount of medication
            waste that occurs due to the over-prescription of medication or when individuals do not finish their entire
            prescription. </p>

                <p>We often are left over with surplus medicines. Many a times, we do not consume all the medicines
                    from a bottle or a strip and then are faced with a dilemma as to what to do with them. On the other
                    hand there are several people who are in need of such expensive medicines in the course of their
                    treatment, but cant afford to buy these.

                    ShareMeds was brainchild of three young boys: Urjil, Youg and Haard. They understood the dilemma
                    faced by those who had surplus medicines as well as those who are medicine deficit. They devised a
                    technique to bridge the gap â€”- they would collect surplus and donate to the deficit areas. </p>

                    <h4>We are four friends named Pooja, Shubham, Harsh, and Piyush who are deeply concerned about the
                        wastage of medicine in our community. We seen firsthand how much medicine was thrown away and
                        how it could have been used to help those in need.

                        Together, We decided to do something about it. We came up with the idea of creating a website
                        where people could donate their unused medicine to those who could not afford it. They worked
                        tirelessly to bring their idea to life, designing the website and reaching out to people in
                        their community to spread the word. </h4>
